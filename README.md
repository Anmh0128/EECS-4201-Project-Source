# EECS-4201-Project-Source

This is the source code for the RISC-V 32-bit Pipeline that I have created.

It contains branching logics, control logics, fully functional F/D/X/M/W stages, with pipeline registers
with stall, forwarding/bypassing logic, and flush using SystemVerilog

With possible further improvement to cache coreherence system when cache is updated along with memory allocations
